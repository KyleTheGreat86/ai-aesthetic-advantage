      question: "How Scottish does Laura actually sound?",
      answer:
        "Laura's got a warm, professional Scottish accent that's been fine-tuned with real Glasgow and Edinburgh voices. She can handle everything from gentle Highland lilt to proper Glaswegian - and clients absolutely love her. You can hear for yourself by calling 07883 299 579.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can she handle thick Scottish accents and dialects?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! Laura's been trained on thousands of Scottish conversations from Aberdeen to Ayrshire. She understands regional slang, local property terms, and even the occasional 'ken what I mean?' She's probably better at understanding Scottish than half the English agents down south!",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if Laura can't answer a question?",
      answer:
        "Laura's smart enough to know when to hand over to a human. She'll politely collect the caller's details, explain she'll get someone to call back, and immediately send you all the information. No frustrated customers, no lost leads.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will Laura work with our existing property management system?",
      answer:
        "Aye, she will! Laura integrates with Rightmove, Zoopla, PropertyFile, and most major UK property systems. We handle all the technical setup - usually takes less than 24 hours and you don't need to touch a thing.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can Laura be up and running?",
      answer:
        "From our wee chat to Laura answering your phones is typically 24-48 hours. We'll spend 30 minutes learning about your properties and preferences, then Laura goes through her Scottish charm school. She'll be ready to book viewings by tomorrow evening.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if we're not happy with Laura's performance?",
      answer:
        "We offer a proper Scottish guarantee: 30 days to try Laura risk-free. If she doesn't bring you at least 3 extra qualified leads in that time, we'll refund every penny. No questions asked, no hard feelings - though that's never happened yet!",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Laura handle emergency property calls?",
      answer:
        "Laura's brilliant for general inquiries and bookings, but for genuine emergencies (burst pipes, break-ins, etc.), she'll immediately connect callers to your emergency number. She knows the difference between 'urgent viewing request' and 'the roof's fallen in'.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much will Laura actually increase our business?",
      answer:
        "Our Scottish agencies typically see 3-8 extra qualified leads per month, with an average revenue increase of Â£9,600 monthly. That's because Laura never sleeps, never takes a holiday, and charms every caller - even at 2am when the competition's phones go to voicemail.",
